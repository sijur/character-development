# Code of Conduct

#### 1. PURPOSE

While the primary goal of the Sapphire Flames Character Development project is to create this character creation site, it shouldn't be taken for granted that the only way that we can create this project is through the developers, graphic designers, contributors, and maintainers that work on this project.

With this in mind we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming atmosphere for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, ability or religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines the expectations of all that contribute to the community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. This code of conduct applies to founders, contributors, and maintainers.

We invite everyone that contributes to the Sapphire Flames Character Development project to help create and maintain a safe, and welcoming environment for everyone involved.

#### 2. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

We expect everyone to treat other team members with respect. We encourage and expect the following behavior from each team member:

- Participate in activities both online and in the event we have offline events to help build a team-like relationship with each of the team members.
- Exercise patterns of respect in your speech and actions toward other team members.
- Attempt to collaborate before a conflict begins.
- Refrain from demeaning language

#### 3. UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR

The following behavior will not be tolerated:

- Violence, of any type whether physical or just violent language.
- Jokes which portray in a negative light any person or persons.
- Posting sexually explicit materials.
- Using language that may be obscene, or insulting in code, or in communication with other team members.
- Unwanted sexual advances.
- Posting or threatening to post other individual's personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults.

Remember it comes down to respect, don't insult, threaten, or call someone something that they don't want to be called.

#### 4. CONSEQUENCES OF UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, whether sponsors, founders, or any contributor will not be tolerated.

Anyone that is asked to stop any unacceptable behavior will be expected to comply immediately.

If any member engages in any type of unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate including but not limited to a temporary or permanent ban or expulsion from the project and the community with or without warning depending on the severity of the unacceptable behavior.
